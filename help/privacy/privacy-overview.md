# Privacy requests with the Adobe Campaign Standard User Interface

Adobe Campaign offers data controllers three methods for performing Privacy access and delete requests of PII data in compliance with privacy acts such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):

* **Via the Privacy Core Service integration:** Privacy requests pushed from [!UICONTROL Privacy Service] to all Experience Cloud solutions are automatically handled by Campaign via a dedicated workflow. 
  
* **Via the API:** Adobe Campaign provides an API that allows the automatic process of privacy requests using REST
  
* **Via the Adobe Campaign interface:** for each privacy request, the data controller creates a privacy request in Adobe Campaign
