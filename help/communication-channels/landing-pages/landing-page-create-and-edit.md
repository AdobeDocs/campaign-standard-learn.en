# Create and edit a landing page {#create-and-edit-a-landing-page}

Adobe Campaign allows you to build landing pages which are online forms that can be used to capture information on your audiences, offer subscriptions to a service, display data and grow your database. Landing pages can also be used for acquiring or updating existing profiles.
