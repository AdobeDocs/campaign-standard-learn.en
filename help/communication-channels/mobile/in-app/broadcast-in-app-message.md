# Broadcast an In-App message

You can broadcast an In-App message, targeting all users of a mobile app whether or not Adobe Campaign has their profile information. To broadcast a message you need to use the **[!UICONTROL Target all users of a mobile app template]** when configuring the In-App message.

Some of the pertinent use cases in this category are:

* Send a mobile app tutorials to first time app launchers or
* Announcements for new feature releases
