# Create a multi-lingual email or SMS delivery

Adobe Campaign allows you to simplify the operational complexities of sending multilingual campaigns. Both email deliveries, and SMS deliveries can be set up as multilingual, which allows you to send the email or SMS based on a profile's preferred language.

This video explains how to create a multi-lingual delivery based on a template on the example of an email newsletter. The approach demonstrated in the videos applies to both email, and SMS deliveries.
