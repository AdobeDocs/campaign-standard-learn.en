# Adding control groups to a delivery

Working with control groups allows you measure the impact your delivery has and allows you to optimize your marketing campaign.  

Adobe Campaign Standard allows you to create a control group, which can be excluded from your target audience, randomly or based on specific criteria. The behavior of the control group can then serve as a benchmark to make a comparison with the behavior of the target population which received the marketing communication.

Learn how to define a control group for your delivery and how to extract the profiles assigned to the control group after the delivery has been sent.
