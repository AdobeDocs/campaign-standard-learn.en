# A/B testing 

The [!UICONTROL A/B Test] functionality in Adobe Campaign allows you to define two to three email variants. Each variant is sent to population samples in order to determine which has the best result. Once determined, the winning variant is then sent to the remaining population. You can choose to vary the email's content, subject, or sender.

This video explains how to configure and send an A/B test, testing the subject line.
