# [!UICONTROL Profile Substitution] - Testing email messages using targeted profiles

This video explains how you can test your email messages using the [!UICONTROL Profile Substitution] feature. It covers the following use case:

We want to send a personalized email newsletter. But, before sending the newsletter, a colleague wants to review it and has asked to send him proofs. We will use the [!UICONTROL Profile Substitution] features to send a proof, as it allows to send an exact representation of the message that the targeted profile will receive.
