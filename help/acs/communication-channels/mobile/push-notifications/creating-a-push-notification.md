# Creating a Push Notification

Learn how to create a push notification in Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS):

Adobe Campaign allows you to send personalized and segmented push notifications to iOS and Android mobile devices. You have two options:

* Send push to Campaign profiles : Allows you to target the Adobe Campaign CRM profiles who have subscribed to your mobile application and have opted in to receive push notifications. You can insert personalization fields into your push notification, such as the recipient's first name.

* Send push to app subscribers : Allows you to send a push notification to all known and anonymous mobile application users who have opted in to receive notifications from your application. You can personalize these messages with data collected from your mobile application.
