# [!UICONTROL Profile Substitution] - Testing email messages using targeted profiles

This video explains how you can test your email messages using the [!UICONTROL Profile Substitution] feature.

We want to send a personalized email newsletter. But before sending the newsletter, a colleague wants to review it and has asked to send him proofs. The [!UICONTROL Profile Substitutions] features allow you to send a proof with the exact representation of the message that the profile will receive.
