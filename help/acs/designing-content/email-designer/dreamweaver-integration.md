# Creating content using Dreamweaver

The Adobe Campaign Standard integration with Dreamweaver lets you edit an email's content in the Dreamweaver interface:

* Bidirectional real time synchronization of the content
* Upload local images to Adobe Campaign through Dreamweaver
* Supports Campaign personalization in Dreamweaver

>[!NOTE]
This feature requires the  Dreamweaver Extension called **Adobe Campaign Integration**. You can download the extension from [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.html#search). For more information on the installation see [Campaign extension for Dreamweaver](https://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/using/working-with-dreamweaver-and-campaign.html).
