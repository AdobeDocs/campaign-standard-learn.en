# Create Fatigue Rules

Fatigue rules allow marketers to set global cross-channel business rules that will automatically exclude over-solicited profiles from campaigns.
To implement fatigue rules, you define a maximum number of messages per profile and select a period on which the rule will apply. During delivery preparation, profiles are excluded from the delivery if applicable, depending on the number of messages already sent to them.
