# Adding SSL certificates

[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Control Panel] allows you to add SSL certificates to secure your subdomains.

## Accessing [!UICONTROL Control Panel] Subdomain Management

To access the Subdomain Management in [!UICONTROL Control Panel], go to:

* [Experience Cloud Home](https://experience.adobe.com/#/home) > [!UICONTROL Solution picker]: [!DNL Campaign] > **[!UICONTROL Control Panel]** card > [!UICONTROL **Subdomains & Certificates**] card
  
  or
* Directly from the URL: [https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/domain](https://experience.adobe.com/#/controlpanel/domain)

## Steps to add SSL certificates

Adding SSL certificates requires three steps:

### 1. Generate [!UICONTROL Certificate Signing Requests]

The [!UICONTROL Certificate Signing Request] (CSR) is required for the purchase of a SSL certificate. It needs to be generated for the instance and the subdomains you are planning to secure.
