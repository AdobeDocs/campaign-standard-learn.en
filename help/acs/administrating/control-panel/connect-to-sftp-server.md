# Connect to a SFTP Server

Connecting to SFTP servers requires:

* Whitelisting the IP address from which you are connecting to the SFTP server  
* Private/public key pair that needs to be registered with Adobe Campaign
* If connecting to the SFTP server directly you will also need SFTP client software
