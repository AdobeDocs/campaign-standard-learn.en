# Create an audience using the Unified Segment Builder

>[!NOTE]
>
>This capability is in beta, and subject to frequent updates and modifications without notice. [!UICONTROL Audience Destinations] is based on Adobe Experience Platform and requires a specific configuration.
>
>Please reach out to [!UICONTROL Adobe Customer Support] if you plan to implement this capability.

Adobe Campaign Standard allows you to build audiences using data from the Adobe Experience Cloud [Real-Time Customer Profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/profiles/understanding-the-real-time-customer-profile.html?lang=en) by using the Adobe Experience Platform [!UICONTROL Unified Segment Builder].

You can access the [!UICONTROL Unified Segment Builder] directly within Adobe Campaign Standard via the [!UICONTROL Audiences ] module. It allows you to manage these audiences directly in the [!UICONTROL Audiences] list view, where you can edit or create an Adobe Experience Platform audience directly from the Adobe Campaign interface

The video below explains how a new audience is created using [!UICONTROL Unified Segment Builder] within Adobe Campaign Standard.
