# Using triggers for transactional messaging - Overview

In the following tutorials you will learn how to configure and use triggers for transactional messaging.

Before you can use a trigger in a transactional message, you need to:

1. [Configure Launch for triggers](/help/integrations/configure-launch-for-triggers.md)
2. [Create a trigger in Experience Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/services/triggers.html?lang=en)
3. [Create a trigger event in Campaign Standard](/help/integrations/create-a-trigger-event.md)

Once the trigger has been configured, it allows you to [configure transactional messages using realtime event data](/help/integrations/configure-transactional-messages-using-realtime-event-data.md).
