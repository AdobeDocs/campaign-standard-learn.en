# [!UICONTROL External Signal activity] - Call a workflow with parameters

The [!UICONTROL External Signal activity] is used to organize and orchestrate different processes that are part of the same customer journey into different workflows. This activity can start one workflow from another. The [!UICONTROL External Signal activity] can call a workflow and pass parameters, like an audience name to target, a file name to import, or a part of the message content, from one workflow to another. It can also call a REST API to integrate with external systems, like a content management system. With the **Test** activity, tests can be run on this functionality.

Learn how to configure [!UICONTROL External Signal activity] to receive parameters** from an external system, customize a workflow with external parameters, and configure an end activity to call a workflow with the external parameters
