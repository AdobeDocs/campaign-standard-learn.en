# Configure and run a workflow with the [!UICONTROL External API activity]

The [!UICONTROL External API activity] is a [!UICONTROL Data Management activity]. It allows you to call an external REST API endpoint. The purpose of this activity is to get personalization data from a third-party system into your campaign.

Example use cases include:

* Getting the latest game-day lineup for a sports event to personalize content
* Getting the latest set of offers
* Connecting to a coupon generation system
* Checking the weather in local regions and using it to personalize content

This video demonstrates the use of the [!UICONTROL External API activity].

>[!NOTE]
>
>The activity is meant for fetching campaign-wide data, not for retrieving specific information for each profile as that can result in large amounts of data being transferred. If the use case requires profile-specific information, the recommendation is to use the Transfer File activity.
