# Manage services and subscriptions{#managing-services-and-subscriptions}

Adobe Campaign allows you to create and manage newsletters and cross-channel communications, through a set of services. Messages can only be sent to profiles who subscribed to the service (opt-in). These profiles are identified using a dedicated filter when creating a message.

Subscription mechanisms can be set up to offer your customers a chance to subscribe to these services, notably though emails and landing pages.

Each service comes with:

* Subscribe (opt-in) and unsubscribe (opt-out) mechanisms.
* Subscribe and/or unsubscribe confirmation mechanisms.
* A subscription history.

This video shows you how to create a service and manage its subscriptions.
