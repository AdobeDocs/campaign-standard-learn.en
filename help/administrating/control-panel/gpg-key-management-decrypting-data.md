# GPG Key management - Decrypting data

Control Panel allows you to decrypt external data coming into your Adobe Campaign instances.
To do this, you need to generate a GPG key pair directly from the Control Panel.
The public key will be shared with the external system, which will use it to encrypt the data to send to Campaign.
The private key will be used by Campaign to decrypt the incoming encrypted data.
Learn how to create a public key and import and install it on a Campaign instance for the decryption of inbound data.
