# Configure [!UICONTROL product listings] in transactional emails

You can configure a re-targeting email that has a list of products, that are unknown when designing the email. These products can be added from the payload at run time. For example, you can automatically send a cart abandonment email listing all the products, that were in the user's cart before they abandoned it, with an image, price, and link to each product.

The following videos explain the steps that are required to configure [!UICONTROL product listings] in [!UICONTROL transactional emails].
