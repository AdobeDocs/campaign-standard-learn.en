# Creating content using Adobe Dreamweaver

The Adobe Campaign Standard integration with Adobe Dreamweaver allows you to edit an email's content directly within the Dreamweaver interface:

* Bidirectional real time synchronization of the content
* Upload local images to Adobe Campaign through Dreamweaver
* Supports Campaign personalization in Dreamweaver

>This feature requires the  Dreamweaver extension called **[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Integration]**. You can download the extension from [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.html#search). For more information on the installation see [Campaign extension for Dreamweaver](https://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/using/working-with-dreamweaver-and-campaign.html).
