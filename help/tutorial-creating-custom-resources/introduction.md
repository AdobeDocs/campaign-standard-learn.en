# Creating custom resourcesâ€‹ - Introduction

[!DNL Adobe Campaign] comes with a pre-defined data model, where data is defined through different resources. [!DNL Campaign] provides the ability to extend resources or create brand new resources.

This multipart tutorial will walk you through the steps needed to create and link custom resources. At the end of this tutorial you will have learned how to:

* Create a custom resource
* Add fields to the custom resource
* Link two custom resources
* Configure screen definition

## Pre requisite

In order to be able to create custom resources, you need to have administration user rights.

## Tutorial Overview

We would like to be able to use additional information on what a customer ordered, so that it is available for marketing and re-marketing purposes.

For this we will enrich the [!DNL Campaign] data model by extending the out of the box resources and adding our own custom tables. We will add a customer and an orders table.
